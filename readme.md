# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple command-line game of Rock Paper Scissors.

## Usage
To play the game, run the script main.py. The program will prompt you to select one of the following options:

_ Rock [r]
_ Paper [p]
_ Scissors [s]

After selecting your option, the computer will randomly select one as well, and the game will determine the winner.

## Optimization
The code has been optimized to remove unnecessary print statements, use the lower() method for user input, follow PEP 8 naming conventions, simplify the is_win() function using a dictionary, and use an if-else statement instead of returning 1 or 0.
